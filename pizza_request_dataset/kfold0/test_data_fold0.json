It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able.

But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.\n\nI have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.\n\nI've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.\n\nAlso, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.\n\nSo here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.\n\nNOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)\n\nEDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.\n\n",

I am currently about 40 dollars in the hole in my bank account (miscalculation of bills) and hardly any food in the house. I could sure use a fresh hot pizza tonight!

Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.\n\n*Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*\n\n\nThe project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.\n\n**So here's the thing:**\nI'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!\n\n**EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, I understand it's kind of hard to describe.**",

        "request_text_edit_aware": "For quite a while now, I have been nonstop hard at work on an interactive multimedia project called [[6x]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmCqEP2v_Wo) - a double-disc immersive experience with hours of puzzles, \"flash films\", trip-tools, hallucinogenic visuals, and TONS of hidden features.  Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.\n\n*Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*\n\n\nThe project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.\n\n**So here's the thing:**\nI'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!\n\n**EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, I understand it's kind of hard to describe.**",

For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. \nSo my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.\n\nAnyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.\n\nI have these:\nHL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam\nEdit: I also have some Wii games(and GC games as I've been trying to sell it all for money). Mario galaxy 2, mario bros wii, and a ton of GC games. Paper mario, luigis mansion, zelda, the good stuff. \n\nI also have Reddit friends that could confirm what I've said above^ So I don't look like some random dude just wanting free food.

For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. \nSo my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.\n\nAnyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.\n\nI have these:\nHL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam",

Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/\n\nIt's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4rTLqft.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HVsPqO6.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ycN1RI2.jpg\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/\n\nIt's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4rTLqft.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HVsPqO6.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ycN1RI2.jpg\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

If I could collect interest or force them to pay, I would, but I'm just not the kind of guy to stress the important ladies in my life just so I can enjoy a small luxury of life; so I'm asking YOUUU!\n\nI don't have much to give in return, but I'm a fairly decent wordsmith and I do still have some l3375k1ll5 online, so I can even play something with you if you're that bored, or write you something.

The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. \n\nThis puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts \"What's wrong?\" I tell him \"You, punching me.\" He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that \"I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!\"\n\nI then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan.

He was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (Self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. He is still in critical condition and I am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. They lost their mother when they were young (Elementary school) and Ethan (The boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. I've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly. \n\nI'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing.\nIf I get enough, I'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family! \n\nHere is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular\n\nThe pizza place (Shaker's) does not deliver so I will have to pick it up. You can order it for September the 28th from 1pm-6pm. You can possibly even preorder it! But if you do decide to order, order it under the name of \"Steeple\". That's how I'll pick it up. Thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! It means a lot. I've been so busy with this concert. \n\nThe pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.\n\nEDIT: Also, please let me know if you order and for what time.\n",

He was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (Self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. He is still in critical condition and I am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. They lost their mother when they were young (Elementary school) and Ethan (The boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. I've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly. \n\nI'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing.\nIf I get enough, I'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family! \n\nHere is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular\n\nThe pizza place (Shaker's) does not deliver so I will have to pick it up. You can order it for September the 28th from 1pm-6pm. You can possibly even preorder it! But if you do decide to order, order it under the name of \"Steeple\". That's how I'll pick it up. Thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! It means a lot. I've been so busy with this concert. \n\nThe pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.\n\nEDIT: Also, please let me know if you order and for what time.\n",

I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (\u00a39 to last until the end of August).\n\nI went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).\n\nFor years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.\n\nThis, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates \u00a3100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a \u00a3970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only \u00a330 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and \u00a340 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her \u00a3500).\n\nI've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.\n\nI spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.\n\nSorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...\n\nBut yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. Thanks for listening &lt;3",

Services like this from major corporations can cost up to $200 dollars just for the same thing i offer and will accept pizza or donations.  ]\n     Today i mowed a large area with someone i know to try and get money, yet that small amount of money is being saved so i can pay my late fees and rent that is accruing which is $100.  Since i haven't ate in a while i got very dizzy and lightheaded and heat exhaustion,  I am recovering from the heat, but hunger has set in.  If i violated anything i'm sorry, this is my first time on here i was referred by an online friend. Thank You for reading and your time!!!\n\n",

I Can NOT remote in without a unique identifier and cannot do it again without authorization from you.  Services like this from major corporations can cost up to $200 dollars just for the same thing i offer and will accept pizza or donations.  ]\n     Today i mowed a large area with someone i know to try and get money, yet that small amount of money is being saved so i can pay my late fees and rent that is accruing which is $100.  Since i haven't ate in a while i got very dizzy and lightheaded and heat exhaustion,  I am recovering from the heat, but hunger has set in.  If i violated anything i'm sorry, this is my first time on here i was referred by an online friend. Thank You for reading and your time!!!\n\n",

I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.\n\nA little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.\n\nThe job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.\n \nI did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.\n\nWhile working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).\n\nWhile I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.\n\nThere I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,\n\nA month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.\n\nSee family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!\n\nJuly 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.\n\nOh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!\n\nCan reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? \n\nI can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.\n\n  ",

Like I said, being sued for 50k, due to a bus accident I caused a year ago in which 14 people were injured (an honest mistake; it was raining, couldn't get out of the way in time, just spun in place). Insurance couldn't cover it all. Had to empty my bank account to pay for a lawyer, and on top of that I got laid off from my job a few months ago. Living with my parents again, and was almost able to move back out, until the accident. Back to square one.\n\nI've always had problems with anxiety and depression, and this is really making me crumble. Had to stop seeing my therapist due to losing my insurance through my job (called some sliding scale clinics but not taking new patients). It would just be nice to eat some comforting pizza. But I can't afford much. \n\nThanks for your consideration and for reading this. If you want proof of some kind I'll provide whatever you need; I know it sounds like kind of a fantastic run of bad luck.",

But why not give it a shot. \n\nI just want a night of greasy comfort food. Like I said, being sued for 50k, due to a bus accident I caused a year ago in which 14 people were injured (an honest mistake; it was raining, couldn't get out of the way in time, just spun in place). Insurance couldn't cover it all. Had to empty my bank account to pay for a lawyer, and on top of that I got laid off from my job a few months ago. Living with my parents again, and was almost able to move back out, until the accident. Back to square one.\n\nI've always had problems with anxiety and depression, and this is really making me crumble. Had to stop seeing my therapist due to losing my insurance through my job (called some sliding scale clinics but not taking new patients). It would just be nice to eat some comforting pizza. But I can't afford much. \n\nThanks for your consideration and for reading this. If you want proof of some kind I'll provide whatever you need; I know it sounds like kind of a fantastic run of bad luck.",

After rent and power I have 70$ per week to live on (that's NZD too); the thing is I brought two 16$ posters for my room in my new flat (kinda a mistake) and now I'm kinda starving. Been eating nothing but noodles and these cheap (disgusting) beef patties all week. \n\nSo yeah I'd appreciate a pizza SO MUCH! I'd be willing to post a funny pic or whatever if that's what people usually do here? cheers guys!",

I'm a second year at Otago uni but I'm still only 17, meaning I live on the unsupported child benefit instead of the Student Allowance. After rent and power I have 70$ per week to live on (that's NZD too); the thing is I brought two 16$ posters for my room in my new flat (kinda a mistake) and now I'm kinda starving. Been eating nothing but noodles and these cheap (disgusting) beef patties all week. \n\nSo yeah I'd appreciate a pizza SO MUCH! I'd be willing to post a funny pic or whatever if that's what people usually do here? cheers guys!",

As a younger kid, I took good food for granted now it has become a priority and I feel foolish for my prior attitude. If nothing else I would love some words of encouragement or anything that's ever helped you when times got tough. And, if it means anything, I will make a promise to do two Random Acts of Pizza whenever it is a little more plausible.\n\nA big thanks to this subreddit, you guys are a real honor to the internet and the power of kindness! Keep up the good work and if you can't help me please do it for someone else as I know you will! :)",

I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.\n\n\nI was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of \"Alright, if you really want to,\" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement \"ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--\"\n\n\nSo we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.\n\n\nSo she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word \"Tony\" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.\nSo I read just the 1 text. It states:\n\"Tony better remember what you asked for last week.\"\nMy stomach got this twisted feeling of \"oh crap how could I forget.\" \n\n\n!!!!! \n\n\nJUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream \"hey wait!\". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)\n\n\nI took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.\n\n\nShe has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said \"I thought you forgot!\".\n\n\nShe took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. \"I will love you until the last pepperoni fades.\" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.\n\n---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.\n\n\nI would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love.",
