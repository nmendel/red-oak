It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able. I'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!\n\nHello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.\n\nI have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.\n\nI've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.\n\nAlso, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.\n\nSo here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.\n\nNOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)\n\nEDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.\n\n",

Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.\n\nHow did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.\n\nNothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.\n\nI somehow took the news alright. I mean, I was definitely plotting my revenge on \"the man\" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.\n\nI drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. Which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and I found myself underneath a 2006 Dodge Charger. \n\nThe driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.\n\nSo now we're at the present moment. I'm on my 5th day of leg elevated bed lock down, the bills are still coming in, and the hunger is rumbling. I heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give it a shot.

Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.\n\n*Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*\n\n\nThe project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.\n\n**So here's the thing:**\nI'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!\n\n**EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, I understand it's kind of hard to describe.**",

For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. \nSo my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.\n\nAnyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time.

        "request_text_edit_aware": "Hello! I was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. \nSo my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.\n\nAnyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.\n\nI have these:\nHL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam",

Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/\n\nIt's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.

Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/\n\nIt's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.

The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. \n\nThis puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts \"What's wrong?\" I tell him \"You, punching me.\" He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that \"I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!\"\n\nI then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan.

I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).\n\nFor years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.\n\nThis, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates \u00a3100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a \u00a3970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only \u00a330 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and \u00a340 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her \u00a3500).\n\nI've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.\n\nI spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.\n\nSorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...\n\nBut yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. Thanks for listening &lt;3",

I haven't ate for almost 3 days and haven't smoked cigarettes either, because i can't afford them, and actually feel a little better, I just have periods where I want to HULK SMASH everything in my apartment!  I do however have 7mg patches that i acquired from the VA administration.  Yes i'm a veteran, but do you really think just because you signed a contract with the federal government they are going to take care of you for the rest of your life? No.  People that deserve disability have to fight for years to get more percentage of benefits and it's hard.  I am on hud but there is no income.  I offer my services for pizza or paypal  I can Remote in to your desktop or laptop PC only, SCREW APPLE!! and optimize and speed up your system.  No files will be viewed including photos and documents.  You can sit in front of the computer and end the connection at any time.  Will update and make sure you have proper protection and use the latest greatest software downloaded and installed right in front of your eyes.   I Can NOT remote in without a unique identifier and cannot do it again without authorization from you.  Services like this from major corporations can cost up to $200 dollars just for the same thing i offer and will accept pizza or donations.  ]\n     Today i mowed a large area with someone i know to try and get money, yet that small amount of money is being saved so i can pay my late fees and rent that is accruing which is $100.  Since i haven't ate in a while i got very dizzy and lightheaded and heat exhaustion,  I am recovering from the heat, but hunger has set in.  If i violated anything i'm sorry, this is my first time on here i was referred by an online friend. Thank You for reading and your time!!!\n\n",

No.  People that deserve disability have to fight for years to get more percentage of benefits and it's hard.  I am on hud but there is no income.  I offer my services for pizza or paypal  I can Remote in to your desktop or laptop PC only, SCREW APPLE!! and optimize and speed up your system.  No files will be viewed including photos and documents.  You can sit in front of the computer and end the connection at any time.  Will update and make sure you have proper protection and use the latest greatest software downloaded and installed right in front of your eyes.   I Can NOT remote in without a unique identifier and cannot do it again without authorization from you.  Services like this from major corporations can cost up to $200 dollars just for the same thing i offer and will accept pizza or donations.  ]\n     Today i mowed a large area with someone i know to try and get money, yet that small amount of money is being saved so i can pay my late fees and rent that is accruing which is $100.  Since i haven't ate in a while i got very dizzy and lightheaded and heat exhaustion,  I am recovering from the heat, but hunger has set in.  If i violated anything i'm sorry, this is my first time on here i was referred by an online friend. Thank You for reading and your time!!!\n\n",

I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.\n\nThe next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle.

I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. \n\nI'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.\nI don't like asking people for help but I love helping others.

I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.\n\nA little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.\n\nThe job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.\n \nI did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.\n\nWhile working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).\n\nWhile I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.\n\nThere I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,\n\nA month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.\n\nSee family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!\n\nJuly 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.\n\nOh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!\n\nCan reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while? \n\nI can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.\n\n  ",

Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.\n\nWhat can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing.

It has been so long since I've had a meal that wasn't rice, beans or noodles. I'm very grateful for what I have, but a pizza would just rock my world! Please let me know what kind of work you would like to have done and any deadlines if possible. Thank you for considering me.",

If you're generous enough to send me pizza, give me your address and as soon as I have money for shipping I will send you out all the German chocolate I have, as well as a post card and a bag of Reeses Peanut Butter cups. I will do anything to make it even with you. And be your pen pal. :)\n\nThanks in advance. Seriously. ",

I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.\n\n\nI was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of \"Alright, if you really want to,\" when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement \"ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--\"\n\n\nSo we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.\n\n\nSo she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word \"Tony\" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name.\nSo I read just the 1 text. It states:\n\"Tony better remember what you asked for last week.\"\nMy stomach got this twisted feeling of \"oh crap how could I forget.\" \n\n\n!!!!! \n\n\nJUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream \"hey wait!\". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)\n\n\nI took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.\n\n\nShe has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said \"I thought you forgot!\".\n\n\nShe took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. \"I will love you until the last pepperoni fades.\" she starting crying like she just won the lottery.\n\n---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.\n\n\nI would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love.",

It would be nice to suddenly have pizza and surprise everyone here ;)... where it is ordered from doesn't bother me, I have never been picky. \n\nThought I would try this out and ask. It would sure brighten my day and the other 3 members of the household as well. \n(Can send photos on receipt! :D and of course a [Thanks] post).",

This was motivated by paying my rent online today and seeing my bank balance shrink (eep), so having one less dinner to worry about would be really nice.  \n\nRight now everything that I am paying is coming out of my student loans since I was unable to find a summer job, and it is stressing me out.  A pizza would just make me feel better! \n\nI will of course try to pay it forward as soon as I can, let's hope that one of these job applications works out~  Thanks for reading, RAOP!",

So i decided to lend him money for gas because the person seemed to be dressed properly, had a decent car, and didnt seem to be a scammer to me. he took me to the nearest atm and i thought he would just ask for 40 dollars for a full tank when he said that he would appreciate around 160 dollars which he could pay back this upcoming saturday. i had 100 dollars in my debit card...so i gave him 80. 20 for myself to buy some needed groceries. He then left repeatedly thanking me for my generosity and said that if i called him this saturday he would repay me the amount as well as a gift certificate at a restaurant that he works at. Now it is sunday, i called him around 10 times on saturday and has not picked up. At this point i am guessing that he isnt going to be paying me back and now i have no money for any kind of food and am very hungry atm. i cooked rice and ate it by itself because i didnt have anything to cook but i am still starving. i would appreciate any kind of kindness reddit",

After living with my father who is schizophrenic bi-polar it became clear that he was extremely depressed by his living situation. He was being used by his wife for money, my father is the kind of person that when you ask something of him it is hard/next to impossible for him to say no. My father was paying rent, utilities, and iphones for 5 members of my stepmother's family. This literally used up 100% of my fathers money monthly. He would stay at home and do nothing but surf and web and read books, all the while my stepmother would use her disability money to buy shit we could not afford and routinely overspend and cause us to have overdraft fees that my father had no way to pay for, I've covered for her mistakes countless times, whenever she overspends she sells something of the family's to cover for her mistakes, the last thing she sold was the family kayak which was bought before they were married, all the while she still would use checks that were in her name to buy fancy furniture, and useless junk. To make matters worse, the stepmother has a son who SMOKES coke and w/e else he can get his hands on. This waste of life step brother of mine decided to get his GF pregnant who then popped out twins (they are religious and don't believe in abortion) The drug addict stepbrother is now a father of two kids when he cannot even support himself, he and his GF have been on welfare since the babies were born and neither have gotten a job or even tried to get their GEDs (yes they dropped out of high school) Now the stepmother spends most of her money on supporting the two kids and her fuck up son, she gives him cash to buy pot, cigs (which they smoke in a closed garage with the kids) I witnessed my stepbrother use his food stamps to buy only ice cream instead of getting real food for his kids and himself. At one point my father confided in me that he had considered suicide, this eneraged me and I decided I would do anything in my power to show my father that this leach of a stepmother cared nothing for him and was using him (he was in love with her and was in denial) I ended up getting evidence that my stepmother had pawned my father digital camera when she said that he had probably lost it. My father confronted her about it and she stood fast in her lie, my father then saw the light that this women was indeed using him and cared nothing for her. (in their 4 years of marriage they only had sex once and on their anniversary my father got her flowers, a card and wanted to take her to dinner but, she ended up going to see her fuck up son's kids instead.) The evidence of her using him continued to rise and rise for a few months until my father decided that he was going to tell her that he wanted a divorce. She ended up ripping out our internet and storming off to her mother's while texting my dad that she wanted the divorce too and that we were not to damage any of her property (oh the irony) or that she would make the divorce as hard as possible and take as much as she could. This was about a week ago and we have begun packing our stuff and preparing to move out, she has no intention of helping pay for the cancellation fees for the phones/net/tv ect. Together we have gotten enough money to pay for one more month so that we have time to move out and into my father's parent's house. Current between the two of us we have about 10$ until our next paychecks and have been eating at my father's parents. I have had to witness my father cry and think of ways to comfort him, he knows that this bitch doesn't really care for him and it is for the best that he gets the divorce but its all really overwhelming even for me, I can't imagine what it is like for a person with a disability such as his. I don't even know what to provide for proof but here is a hate email that my stepmother sent my father after he told her he wanted a divorce, its actually comic at some parts and really shows her true colors, some context though, I clean up after myself not my stepbrother and his two kids.\n\n***YOU chose to allow your son to attack me and NEVER SAID HE WAS TO STOP!!!! A true husband protects his wife from everyone. Instead you sat there only saying I was to calm down. He is a spoiled brat because you never had him in your life. Where was he all those years until HE was going to be on the street. He disrespected your ex who you claim to care so much about. He has anger issues ANGER ISSUES. TEARING DOWN A DOOR God, what would he do to ME, someone he hates, if I didn't stand up to his lies. I fully intend to prove your precious camera, which, btw was purchased in your manic fit. We had all your fancy cameras as well as a perfectly good digital. Now, you make IT and that little devil separate us. I believe in Jesus Christ and AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, I WILL SERVE THE LORD. He believes in the internet..... PERIOD. I stopped feeling safe in my home when he attacked me the first time. He climbs on your lap makes me sick that you cannot see his making fun of you when he shakes your belly. He is a sick puppy. Everyone who has seen the ghostly boy says he is way strange the way he stays in his room all the time.\n\nI told you the sex was what I got hurt doing. I never spoke up as to why, but when you dropped the dream of the surgery I knew you wanted to be diabetic and heavy all your life. I lost respect for you because even your family was encouraging you. For all I know anyway, maybe they weren't and you hid it from me. All I know is you don't ever want to go do anything and I am a very active person when I am having a good day from absence of pain. At least I see people when I go shopping and I recycle instead of buying expensive items we cannot pay for.\n\nI have tried hard to keep a nice home for you and you have to be reminded to CLEAN CAT LITTER AND FEED. I can't do it all without feeling USED!\n\nI raised my kids to help out...what happened to your Ryan, he is above lifting a finger. Does he even know how to clean his own (mostly his) bathroom. Cleaners are right on shelf and I have pretty towels that makes it nice and he chooses to disrespect and not use his towels instead. What disrespect.\n\nI am not a happy person now or before I left there.\n\nI hope you are happy that you allow your baby boy to separate us. YOU DID THIS.\n\nMy son WILL BE HELPING ME MOVE SO MAKE RYAN GO TO HIS MIKEY'S HOUSE WHEN WE ARE MOVING. My Son is angry for what unhappiness his Mother is under because of little boy Satan. Dustin told me two months ago that Ryan is pushing us to divorce. Pretty smart boy who adores his Mom. Dustin and Roy protect Me like you will not. ***\n\nI have no idea if anyone will even read all this as it is 2 am and I did a horrible job of explaining our situation but if anyone would like clarification you can add me on skype rcroslin@live.com\n",

I have had to witness my father cry and think of ways to comfort him, he knows that this bitch doesn't really care for him and it is for the best that he gets the divorce but its all really overwhelming even for me, I can't imagine what it is like for a person with a disability such as his. I don't even know what to provide for proof but here is a hate email that my stepmother sent my father after he told her he wanted a divorce, its actually comic at some parts and really shows her true colors, some context though, I clean up after myself not my stepbrother and his two kids.\n\n***YOU chose to allow your son to attack me and NEVER SAID HE WAS TO STOP!!!! A true husband protects his wife from everyone. Instead you sat there only saying I was to calm down. He is a spoiled brat because you never had him in your life. Where was he all those years until HE was going to be on the street. He disrespected your ex who you claim to care so much about. He has anger issues ANGER ISSUES. TEARING DOWN A DOOR God, what would he do to ME, someone he hates, if I didn't stand up to his lies. I fully intend to prove your precious camera, which, btw was purchased in your manic fit. We had all your fancy cameras as well as a perfectly good digital. Now, you make IT and that little devil separate us. I believe in Jesus Christ and AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, I WILL SERVE THE LORD. He believes in the internet..... PERIOD. I stopped feeling safe in my home when he attacked me the first time. He climbs on your lap makes me sick that you cannot see his making fun of you when he shakes your belly. He is a sick puppy. Everyone who has seen the ghostly boy says he is way strange the way he stays in his room all the time.\n\nI told you the sex was what I got hurt doing. I never spoke up as to why, but when you dropped the dream of the surgery I knew you wanted to be diabetic and heavy all your life. I lost respect for you because even your family was encouraging you. For all I know anyway, maybe they weren't and you hid it from me. All I know is you don't ever want to go do anything and I am a very active person when I am having a good day from absence of pain. At least I see people when I go shopping and I recycle instead of buying expensive items we cannot pay for.\n\nI have tried hard to keep a nice home for you and you have to be reminded to CLEAN CAT LITTER AND FEED. I can't do it all without feeling USED!\n\nI raised my kids to help out...what happened to your Ryan, he is above lifting a finger. Does he even know how to clean his own (mostly his) bathroom. Cleaners are right on shelf and I have pretty towels that makes it nice and he chooses to disrespect and not use his towels instead. What disrespect.\n\nI am not a happy person now or before I left there.\n\nI hope you are happy that you allow your baby boy to separate us. YOU DID THIS.\n\nMy son WILL BE HELPING ME MOVE SO MAKE RYAN GO TO HIS MIKEY'S HOUSE WHEN WE ARE MOVING. My Son is angry for what unhappiness his Mother is under because of little boy Satan. Dustin told me two months ago that Ryan is pushing us to divorce. Pretty smart boy who adores his Mom. Dustin and Roy protect Me like you will not. ***\n\nI have no idea if anyone will even read all this as it is 2 am and I did a horrible job of explaining our situation but if anyone would like clarification you can add me on skype rcroslin@live.com\n",

I still have to pay 300$ to my ex, 200$ to my credit card, 100$ this month for bills, and then yesterday i got four tickets, two in my moms name, and two in my aunts, for stuff I couldn't take care of at the beginning of the month. Grass, because I had no mower, and trash because people keep running over my trash cans. So I have no idea what im going to do about those yet. I'll probably have to end up paying them. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's my turn to cook for myself, and my two friends who are living with me trying to help me keep the place clean. For the past week they've been cooking delicious meals filled with juicy chicken and scrumptious ground beef. So... I would feel kind of bad just making ramen for them. So, two pizzas would go a long way. Fortunately, on this upcoming check, I have 5 hours of overtime pay, so I would be more than happy to push back the creditcard bill for a little while to return the favor.

It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, \"Today I'm going to try heroin.\"\n\nIt was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?\n\nWell eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.\n\nSo yeah. That's my story.

I just moved to the area to be with her because I love her, and haven't been able to find a job to help support us yet, which is unfortunate because her roommate just bailed on her. I did manage to secure a 200/mo food stamp benefit, which renews on the first of the month. But we couldn't manage to make it stretch the whole month our first time around, and we've been living off Ramen since the weekend. I'm sure we'll be able to properly ration ourselves next month, if we're more careful. And I have no problem living on ramen. I just want to do something nice for her since I feel like I'm sitting on my ass all day not contributing anything, looking for jobs on craigslist while she's away at work/stuck on the bus. She's been really upset about the money situation lately, and I just want her to be happy. Unfortunately, she is not as pleased with the Ramen diet as I am. I would give anything to be able to give her something better than this to come home to.\n\nSorry for that wall of text/sob story.
