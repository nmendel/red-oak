Im lonely up here and all my friends and roommates are home for the summer so its just me up here. I recently split from my girlfriend so that isnt helping my situation. I do have a job but im only getting 10 hours a week (even for summer) so im super low on money right now and havent been able to eat out in weeks. I know most posts arent like this or maybe they are im kinda new to this community, but i would greatly appreciate a pizza, even a personal mini one. Anything at all would boost my spirits and hopefully get me out of this funk. Im here to stay and as soon as i can get enough money to buy myself a pizza ill return the favor and reward someone else in much greater need. Cheers!",

I hope everyone has had an awesome day.\n\nLike the post says, I simply lack the energy today to cook. I tried taking Effexor (an anti-depressant drug) and it didn't go well for me (lots of nausea and loss of appetite) so I decided to not take take it anymore. Of course, going off of an anti-depressant makes you kind of moody and that's where I am now. \n\nSo, I'm here in hopes that someone will toss a pizza my way.\n\n\nP.S.: if you need verification, I can send you a verification code as well as a picture of the pills/pill bottle.",

Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought \"Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?\" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D\n\nI hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. \n\nAnyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post.

Please and thank you :)\n\n[Pics of my room](http://imgur.com/a/qRQa7).\n\n**Edit**: I appreciate having the opportunity to do something like this. Unfortunately, the store will be closing soon and I have not done any painting today. Based on the comments below, I've decided on a nice shade of green. Please remember that the world needs more kindness and compassion - Treat others like you wish to be treated, make each day count and follow your dreams. I will be back to post pictures of my newly painted room. Thank you Random Acts of Pizza for all that you do!",

I have had a hectic month and have all but run out of money, by the time i realised i wasn't getting paid till the 1st i had maybe 3 or 4 pounds left in my account. Now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. Now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza. \n\n\nBut with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st. So for one week i lived on the 11p noodles at tescos, 3 meals a day of 11p noodles, With the promise of a pizza on the 1st though, my mind was battling through. 28th of Feb and low and behold it is a leap year this year....ok i say, that's fine, one more day, few more noodles i can deal,  I've come this far already. \n\n\nThe first hits, and the thought of my pizza is incredible, my mouth is watering at the idea as i get out of bed. And the first thing i do is go to check my balance and pay my rent....Oh what's that? yes. My bank details were stolen? Virus on my computer? Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself. Tomorrow.\n\n\ni head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, Phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. Oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza. Well i forgot about that. and manage to fall asleep at about 5am that night waking up for bank closing on saturday. Great. Tomorrow is sunday. No pizza then either, And if my card doesn't arrive tomorrow i may have to wait even longer for my pizza. So i call out to you. To all you Pizza samaritans. Help me. In my hour of need, I call upon you reddit.",

I have had a hectic month and have all but run out of money, by the time i realised i wasn't getting paid till the 1st i had maybe 3 or 4 pounds left in my account. Now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. Now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza. \n\n\nBut with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st. So for one week i lived on the 11p noodles at tescos, 3 meals a day of 11p noodles, With the promise of a pizza on the 1st though, my mind was battling through. 28th of Feb and low and behold it is a leap year this year....ok i say, that's fine, one more day, few more noodles i can deal,  I've come this far already. \n\n\nThe first hits, and the thought of my pizza is incredible, my mouth is watering at the idea as i get out of bed. And the first thing i do is go to check my balance and pay my rent....Oh what's that? yes. My bank details were stolen? Virus on my computer? Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself. Tomorrow.\n\n\ni head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, Phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. Oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza. Well i forgot about that. and manage to fall asleep at about 5am that night waking up for bank closing on saturday. Great. Tomorrow is sunday. No pizza then either, And if my card doesn't arrive tomorrow i may have to wait even longer for my pizza. So i call out to you. To all you Pizza samaritans. Help me. In my hour of need, I call upon you reddit.",

It's not much but we get by.  \n\nThe reason I'm requesting tonight is because my mom decided to take what money we had saved up to buy food for us for thanksgiving and for the next week so that she could buy alcohol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets.  I'm not sure why she did this but it leaves us with very little food for the week.  All I'm asking for is a pizza or two that could feed my family and I for the next two days until I get paid on Wed.  Thanks in advance.",

If a kind stranger could throw some food my way, I'd be very appreciative!\n\n\nIn return, I give one of my favourite Internet reads\n\nhttp://www.omegleconversations.com/urinate-in-catless-peace.html\n\nand also my steam name: [eiramasil] and SC2 information [eira.506] because I'd love to be able to game with anyone who helps me out.\n\n\nThanks and have a great week ~",

He included a special request to have the pepperonis arranged in a smile and would personally place 2 breadsticks on the pizza to give it a mustache. \n\nThis always put a smile on her face. My younger brother has autism and my mother has Multiple Sclerosis but has still been working her ass of through the pain.\n\nShe lost her job at the end of last August and a month later my father passed away. I just got off the phone with her and she was holding back tears. I really want to make her smile by bringing back some of the good memories of my father and reminding her that there is good in the world.\n\nI do not have a credit card and only have $4 in my bank. I would really like to send her a smiley-face pizza. Can anyone help me put a smile on the most wonderful woman in the world's face?\n\nI promise to pay it forward as soon as I have the funds.\n\n**Edit**\nUSA - AL",

In short:\n\n* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. \n\n* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia\n\n* Got rejected.\n\n* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.\n\n* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems\n\n* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).\n\n* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. \n\n* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.\n\n* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.\n\n* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. \n\nAside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger. \n",

        "request_text_edit_aware": "Hi. These last two weeks have sucked, and I would really appreciate not worrying about one thing--namely, food--after all the torrential bad events I've experienced. In short:\n\n* Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs. \n\n* Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia\n\n* Got rejected.\n\n* Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.\n\n* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems\n\n* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).\n\n* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. \n\n* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.\n\n* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.\n\n* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. \n\nAside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger. \n",

I've helped people on the street with meals before but this is something beautifully different. \n\nI am a young woman living with my longtime boyfriend and like a lot of people, times are tough. I had a temporary lay off with my job that i just went back to but wont be receiving a paycheck until next Friday. My boyfriend wont be paid from his work until the 6th. Had dental work done recently that took about 190 bucks to fix my teeth. I used my last can of chili beans and mixed it with white rice last night for dinner. Many nights we go without dinner(sometimes i survive on cups of coffee all day) but we never lose sight that things will get better for us eventually. We are in the middle class rut; don't make enough to survive comfortably in California but are making too much money for food assistance. It leaved us caught in a limbo. Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone. \n\nIt seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me. I would love a pizza for dinner and with the leftovers, eat for breakfast and lunch. We live in Union City, California in the shadows of both the great Silicon Valley and the San Fransisco Bay. Right smack in the middle where apartments are tiny but cost you an arm and a leg to live there. \n\nThank you guys for taking the time to create such a wonderful service to help your fellow man. I WILL be paying it forward when i get on my feet, if only a simple pie to a struggling family. \n\nemail me at l0serl0ve7@gmail.com if you could help us.

I work full time plus overtime.....but I work for salary so the overtime is moot. My husband is struggling with a decision to go through the disability process at such a young age, or to work on a knee that desperately needs surgery but he doesn't have insurance. Applying for disability is a long process and I don't know if we can wait much longer. Anyway, I'd be happy to make it the next couple of days. We are blessed with a little help from food stamps and we have a very generous local pantry. However we're hungry now and the food stamps are long gone, mainly due to a refrigerator that stopped working and spoiled $100 worth of food. (Really hard to stretch $250 over a month's time for a family of 6). We will get pantry food on Wednesday and they even provide clothes. Just need a little help to get by for a couple of days.\n\nEDIT: I'm speechless. [sumpinlikedat](http://www.reddit.com/user/sumpinlikedat) responded immediately when I was being down voted and not expecting even a comment. Looking at the history this is a very kind and generous person. Thank you so much!! Our little ones are going to be so excited tonight!",

I work full time plus overtime.....but I work for salary so the overtime is moot. My husband is struggling with a decision to go through the disability process at such a young age, or to work on a knee that desperately needs surgery but he doesn't have insurance. Applying for disability is a long process and I don't know if we can wait much longer. Anyway, I'd be happy to make it the next couple of days. We are blessed with a little help from food stamps and we have a very generous local pantry. However we're hungry now and the food stamps are long gone, mainly due to a refrigerator that stopped working and spoiled $100 worth of food. (Really hard to stretch $250 over a month's time for a family of 6). We will get pantry food on Wednesday and they even provide clothes. Just need a little help to get by for a couple of days.\n",

I'm a college student living in Hamilton ohio, I've just finished pulling my third all nighter for a final project in the last four days.

I would love an e-card to larosas, papa johns, or marcos, since those are the only places within a reasonable driving distance for me.  Again, thank you for reading this post, and REALLY thank you if someone decides to make my fourth all nighter a lot less depressing. ",

We're not without food, but I know that she loves pepperoni and mushroom pizza. \n\nWhat's left in the bank and what's coming in the next check will all go to bills, so I really have no way of treating her to her favorite. I've worked hard to provide for my family, but I feel like less of a man when I can't. I'm hoping someone can help me treat my wife to her favorite and that she will handle the situation well.

Sorry for not posting the state in the title guys.\n\nIf this sub is anything like the rest of Reddit I might get a little sympathy for being a total idiot my entire life. To make a long story short I was born in Salt Lake so I was branded LDS from conception. My 21st birthday party was a trip to temple to hear president Hinckley (our \"Prophet\" at the time) speak about family. Even then I thought that was a lousy birthday. Up until yesterday I held priesthood in the church and was a key toting, card carrying member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nThat is no longer the case, I got up in the middle of sacrament on Sunday, and, after a less than friendly chat with our Bishop yesterday, I am officially done with religion. I've been on the ropes for years but the cowpies just got stacked one too high lately. So I've had enough. If God exists he certainly doesn't look well upon the LDS followings. You know how much garbage I caught for buying a cup of coffee on Sunday? Way too much. For one thing caffeine is a no no but another lesser known of my former beliefs is we're not supposed to do anything business related on the Sabbath day. No dining out, no work, no grocery shopping, etc. And the fact that I bought something turned almost the whole congregation on me. That was some good coffee too.\n\nSo basically I've spent 28 years trying hard to believe in something, spent 2 years in Japan trying to make other people believe it with me, and now I'm pretty much alone because of my refusal to believe in the most ridiculous things our church kept pushing on me. I got 2 friends who aren't LDS, the others won't stick with me after renouncing their religion so I'm in the market for new friends to boot lol.\n\nIf you have any questions about the spooky and mysterious world of Mormonism ask away. And if you could spare some dinner for a guy who's tax check hasn't arrived yet you'd have my blessing and gratitude. And no, not a religious kind of blessing. More like a walk tall and drink lots of water kinda blessing lol. Hope you're all having a nice day and thanks for reading.",

Have you ever thought its strange that people think it is ok to ask for money from total strangers but they think it is too much to ask to get into a personal conversation with people who help them? I think most the people here are have good intentions for giving away pizza and dont need to be treated like a stalker or rapist or whatever. Im not going to open up my whole life to you, but I promise more than trivial conversation and interaction.\n\nAnd I really need this pizza, Im saving for college, Ive been eating really cheap food lately.\n\nI live in Gig Harbor, Washington\n\nThe reason I dont have many posts on reddit is that I am not able to access my old account under the name \"arquebus\", it says that no email exists for that name, so I dont know how to get it back. I used to post a lot at www.reddit.com/r/programming/ under that name",

I am a simple pepperoni type person, but I love trying new things.\n \nThis isn't a sob story of any kind, I just want a pizza. If you'd like, I am in the Orange County **~*area*.**\n\nI would love to pay this forward to someone some time. The idea of RAoP is awesome; giving the present of ooey-gooey-pizza goodness is amazing. \n\nI hope to get a Redditor who expands my tastes! \n\n*P.S. I never had anchovies. I love all meats. Cheese?

I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.\n\nI lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.\n\nHe's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.\n\nHe's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.\n\nAnyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?\n\nI don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.",

I don't have any meal plans left for the semester (ends Monday the 19th), and I can basically only feed him a sandwich or Cheerios. It would be awesome if someone could help out. I just spent all of my money on my monthly bills and books for next semester. Please and thank you!\n\nEDIT: I can verify that I'm human or whatever. I will also try to do a random act of kindness for someone this weekend.",

About 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and I got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. To rectify this, Dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. Things went from best friends to Relationship pretty fast. But Dave had a boyfriend she never saw. Literally, NEVER. He asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. Eventually, I told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. So I cut it off. Fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. I wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. She frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. This time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. I didn't regret it at first. I do now. Dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. But for some dumb reason, I still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. I wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that I thought was the girl of my dreams. I still want to fix it. But she just hurts me.

She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her \"diet\", and baby food.\n\nWhat I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!\n\nThanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.\n\nTL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to. I'm terrible at writing.\n\n::EDIT::\nNVM! My mother invited me over to dinner and to pick me up as well. (parents are divorced)\nA concerned friend also invited me out to dinner and asked if I needed cat food. I have four cats but I assured the friend they are fine and they truly are. I have 2 full bags of cat food. :)\nThanks to anyone who read and I'm delighted that I will eat tonight!!!",

As for a pizza, if someone feels like getting me one that would be cool as I am broke until Friday, and we don't have much food here, also we have roaches so a lot of the food is contaminated. Ugh. A pepperoni + bell pepper pie from someone would really give me a little hope.\n\nThanks for reading...",
