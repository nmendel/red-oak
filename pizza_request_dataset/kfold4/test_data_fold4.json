Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work.

Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.\n\nThe reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again.

I slept in, cleaned up the place, went for a walk and came back with nothing to do. Even the programs on tv aren't that entertaining. I have a choice between Keeping up with the Kardashians and Pregnant and Dating. No thank you. I think I'll keep the tv off for now.         \n\nI would greatly appreciate something random and delicious, since my Saturday has been pretty ho hum so far.  Nothing fancy, but I would totally dig a cheese pizza. I would be so grateful if someone would be willing to treat me to some pizza tonight. Thank you.\n",

I find myself getting lost in threads, especially about memes, iama, and askreddit. I have to admit, I browse more than I make actual responses because I usually don't have the time to sit down and type out a response.           \n\nSo today I find myself with nothing important to do. I slept in, cleaned up the place, went for a walk and came back with nothing to do. Even the programs on tv aren't that entertaining. I have a choice between Keeping up with the Kardashians and Pregnant and Dating. No thank you. I think I'll keep the tv off for now.         \n\nI would greatly appreciate something random and delicious, since my Saturday has been pretty ho hum so far.  Nothing fancy, but I would totally dig a cheese pizza. I would be so grateful if someone would be willing to treat me to some pizza tonight. Thank you.\n",

My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father!

I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!\n\nAfter a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!\n\nI'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid.

I thank the dozens of folks who offered encouragement in thread and through PM as well as the others who flamed and trolled me so diligently.

My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.\n\n\nMy two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.\n\n\nI would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!\n\n\nThe pic for our huge TECO deposit :/\nhttp://imgur.com/B0uoo",

Since I'm disabled, and still waiting for my benefits to start, I knew I could never afford a place for myself.. So I did what most people in my situation would do.. I had faith that between my family and all my friends..  SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought.. Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. Since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, I had to move on to my good friends.. My best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn't an option.. My other best friend AND neighbor would definitely take me in.. I just knew she would!!  She has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. So I asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. Without even pretending to think about it.. She said \"I don't have any room for you\".. That was it.. I had exhausted all my options.. One day before my eviction I started to plan the best way to be homeless.. I decided to live in my van.... Scary doesn't come close to how I felt, but my fear was deep.... Ring Ring! It's Curtis.. A friend I met thru my best friend.. I knew him and considered him a friend but we didn't know each other very well.. Without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  I burst into tears.. I was relieved.. But mostly, I was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as I am!  So here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. Trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat TONIGHT.. Let alone tomorrow.. But It's 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. I want Curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!  Thanks for reading! :)",

I worked through lunch (I just forgot) and for dinner they only had chicken (I worked at a chicken factory, so it's kind of difficult for me to eat chicken and not feel at least a little queasy), I ate a couple bowls of cereal but I think I'm going to be up pretty late as I'm also studying for a polisci exam on Tuesday, and I am already getting the rumbles, if someone could help me out this evening, I would truly appreciate it and be more than willing to pay it forward.\n\nEdit: The only place that delivers here (there is one other, but the owner verbally abused a good friend of mine while she was at work for not handing out flyers the day after he dropped them off at the office) actually closes at 11, but thank you for taking the time to read it, have a good day and  if you're looking for a sign to buy someone a pizza or you're just too embarrassed to request one, go for it, take part in this community!",

Spent 2 hours this afternoon in the Department of Social Services office trying to see if I qualified for any assistance. Tomorrow I will go on the 30 day processing list for SNAP, they accepted a medicaid application for me and my daughter, and put me on the 2 year waiting list for daycare assistance. I picked her up from daycare and brought her home to give her a bath and as we were filling up the tub I noticed it looked dirty. Then it looked really dirty and red. I stopped the water and got her out of the tub and checked all of our faucets. All had icky brownish red water coming out of them. Needless to say, I'm not cooking tonight and am waiting for the utility company to call me back. Would anyone like to send a pizza to Wilmington, NC to cheer up my 4 year old who thought she took a bath in blood?\n\nEdit: Picture of gratitude http://i.imgur.com/D0gt4.jpg",

Spent 2 hours this afternoon in the Department of Social Services office trying to see if I qualified for any assistance. Tomorrow I will go on the 30 day processing list for SNAP, they accepted a medicaid application for me and my daughter, and put me on the 2 year waiting list for daycare assistance. I picked her up from daycare and brought her home to give her a bath and as we were filling up the tub I noticed it looked dirty. Then it looked really dirty and red. I stopped the water and got her out of the tub and checked all of our faucets. All had icky brownish red water coming out of them. Needless to say, I'm not cooking tonight and am waiting for the utility company to call me back. Would anyone like to send a pizza to Wilmington, NC to cheer up my 4 year old who thought she took a bath in blood?\n",

My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are \"resealing\" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.  If someone would send a pizza to our new place it would make me (and I'm sure my brother...he loves pizza) the happiest mover that has ever walked the planet!",

When it comes time for maternity leave as the lil' redditor is close to being born, scumbag corporation says 'don't worry, all of your benefits will continue, you'll get paid leave, have fun with teh baby cuddles.' \n\nWell, we really wish it had worked out like that :( I took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to FMLA. 7 Weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. \n\nLuckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. We'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven. As soon as we get caught up financially, which according to my strict budget won't be until late November, I plan on doing the same for another redditor in need! \n\ntl,dr; My company is basically making me pay for my maternity leave after the fact, to the sum of $2400.

I wish I had a sad story to tell but to be honest I was at the Philadelphia Folk Festival for the weekend and stupidly spent all my money, forgetting that my cabinets were empty back at home. Now I'm sitting here, tummy grumblin, on the verge of a headache, hoping to God that someone will show me alittle empathy. Thank you for your time and good day.\n\nEDIT: around the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area.",

        "request_text": "So I had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and I stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading. \n\nHe took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.\n\nToday I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. \n\nAlso being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. \n\nTL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To \"protect\" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.\n\nedit: never done this so forgive me. forgot to add that im in the san diego area\n\nedit2: RZF291 is a scholar and a gentlemen!

Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading. \n\nHe took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.\n\nToday I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. \n\nAlso being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. \n\nTL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To \"protect\" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.\n",

Aside from cheating on me she spent all my money and what little I had left went straight to the divorce. I'm down to my last $35.00-----period. This is AFTER selling everything I have that I don't still owe money on. I literally own nothing else but clothes, computer, car, and a dryer. My friends and family have already helped far too much and I'd hate to ask for more favors. I'm ALL out of groceries and won't begin to collect unemployment for another week or two. I didn't eat at all yesterday. \n\nI was wondering if there was someone out there who would be kind enough to feed me today. I don't care what size or whats on it, I just need something to eat.\n",

Please someone help me out!\n\nEDIT: I have received a pizza before from jerematic, I had put up a request and jerematic had put up an offer shortly after, after getting the pizza from jerematic I deleted my request since I had already gotten a pizza. Thanks Matt_and_Chelle for the help!",

The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.\n\nI also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.\n\nAnd then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.\n\n(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) \n\nMy boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.\n\nSo, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.\n\nSorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(\n\nTL;DR: Broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway.

Pay is ok but the shitty thing is that I get a check once a month. Pay day is not til August 8 and the money I have saved is for rent/groceries. Can't afford eating out and  all the stores (that have food) will be closed by the time I get home. ( I live in the \"cuts\" (working class, , lower economic ladder neighborhood; suburban \"firstworldproblem\" type people might call it a \"ghetto\" or a \"hood\" but to me it's great place with cheap rent with great neighbors but a poor ratio of liquor stores to supermarkets or corner stores will actual food) \n\nEDIT : Thanks to everyone who upvoted this. I have received information regarding an ecard to use to get pizza. THANK YOU REDDIT FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN!",

However my body is adjusting to the activity level which is one of the highest in my life - I also dance daily since I found rhythmic movement is necessary for me to regulate my emotions and impulses. However since I'm broke due to screwing up my landlady's dirt patch and rent being due, I'm on the beans/ramen/seitan diet which I don't actually mind at all except I dropped six pounds in the past week and every muscle in my body hurts in a new way. I can't afford used clothes from the thrift store anytime this month unless I get birthday money, can't afford to take the bus home, and I don't get paid til Thursday. \n\nThe pizza wouldn't just be for me. Fortunately I live with two wonderful supportive lovers (closed poly triad). My bf helped me out giving me a lift home a couple times because cars beep at me and people yell stuff while walk home from work exhausted :( Our gf is in chronic pain and feeling depressed due to trying to be a bio major after going through two windshields and injuring her ankle BAD on the job when I met her. I would love to cheer her up with cheesy goodness, since they are also broke.\n\nThanks RAOP!",

We get paid on the 15th of every month at my job, and when I looked when I paid all my bills for the first half of the month, I thought the 15th was a Sunday which means we would have got our paychecks tomorrow (Friday since they do not direct deposit on the weekend).\n\nThe first half of the month always kills me in bills so I know to be tight with money until I get paid next...well, I didn't expect to not have any money all weekend. Whoops. It is totally my fault though, since I totally looked at the wrong date. Derp.\n\nAnyways, just looking for some dinner tonight that will last over into breakfast/lunch tomorrow, but I am not poor or needy by any stretch of the imagination, **SO THAT MEANS THAT IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE POSTING THAT SOUNDS AS IF THEY NEED THIS PIZZA WAY MORE THAN ME, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF CHEESE GIVE IT TO THEM OVER ME!**\n\nI just want to get a pizza today and pay for it once I get paid, so that means if you buy me a pizza, come Monday you can (read: **YOU GOTTA DO IT MAN**) PM me saying *Hey, I bought you that pizza on Thursday, I want my pizza back now bitch.\"* and you'll have a pizza sent right to your door!\n\nOr, if you're feeling x2 times as generous, email me a link from RAoP that you chose and feel is needing a pizza, and I'll randomly send them a pizza. Pretty much, I feel shitty asking for a pizza tonight because it is just piss poor planning on my part with my pay, so I'd love to just give the pizza back to you next week or give it to someone else you deem is worthy.",

I have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when I don't talk to at least one of my siblings via Steam or Facebook. I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.\n\nTheir financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. I've been where they are, and I know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food. \n\nHere's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jDz5L.jpg\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who's taken the time to read this.",

Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.\n\nTheir financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. I've been where they are, and I know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food. \n\nHere's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jDz5L.jpg\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who's taken the time to read this.",

But we have no where else to go. I will have money soon but not in time for it to help. (Pulling my Tsp, Retirement) and what not.\nI have 1 boy 2 yrs and a pregnant wife and 2 older people, one on oxygen. I would love to be able to do something nice as a treat for them but i have no money.\nAnything would be amazing, I'm not saying we Need it but i would rather not eat bean soup again and give us something nice to talk over.\nYou can call me and we can talk a bit, if you are willing to help, or even if not Just message me.\nThank you in advance anyone willing to help.",

We recently applied to get SNAP assistance but haven't heard back yet.. So the fridge is getting empty to the point of silliness.\n\nThat being said, to add a little motivation i guess, If I manage to get a pie I'll build you a shrine  in my SMP Minecraft world. :D Will provide pictures as well to prove it all.\n\n(Papa Johns is the only chain store that is in my area, but there's a ton of little mom and pop stores that offer like $5 pies)",

        "request_text": "Hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \"dick\"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([Ana](http://i.imgur.com/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.\n\n.\n\nPS: When we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward. Today you, tomorrow me.\n",

There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.\n\nUnfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a \"crazy cat lady\" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)\n\nI have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)\n\nAnyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.\n\nThanks!",

Some background info: my husband was in an auto accident on 8/14 and when he was finally able to return to work 9/7, he was told there is not enough work for him and that he should look for a new job.  THIS after he was working 55-60 hours a week before the accident (he was a passenger).  We went through our savings during his time out and have overdrawn our Netspend account over $90.  Our family has been living off of boxed mashed potatoes and the cheap boxed mac and cheese.  I have used the food bank already this month and I am waiting on DSS to approve my food stamp app.  I am trying to do everything right.\nIt is 4:55 and every kid (ages 15, 13, 13 and 7) has all been asking about dinner.  They know their dad lost his job but they don't know about our financial situation of not only being broke but being negative in the bank.  \nI am not worried about myself or my husband eating.  I would just really like for my children to have a filling dinner.  We have no bread, no milk, no meat.  Just one cheese and one pepperoni pizza would mean more to my family than I can express.  I know we will be back on our feet within a month.  I have faith in that.  I am a strong believer in paying it forward.  Any info or verification you need, please don't hesitate to ask.  I do have a verification code if someone is willing to help.\nThank you for taking the time to read and consider my request.  This is very humbling but I want to put my pride away in hopes of my family having a filling meal tonight.",

Basically im pretty broke at the moment. I live with a roommate but i really dont want to go through her fridge and be \"that guy\" who eats what he wants even if it isnt his. I make minimum wage (30hrs a wekk) in my state but luckily i work about 3 miles away so i dont spend much on fuel. I have 3 children and i was divorced almost a year ago. About half my monthly income goes to child support and random bills (i was an idiot and got a title loan at a desperate time in my life and i still have to pay a pretty hefty monthly payment for a few more months. My state says i make too much to receive food stamps so i have to pay for all my food with cash and also food for when i get my children on the weekends (i want to make sure they have 3 good healthy meals a day when theyre here). so heres where i ask, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, will you please buy me some pizza, im sure it will be left overs and help me out through out the week until im payed on friday. im willing to do whatever tasks im needed to earn this pizza.

Two weeks ago my SO and I went to visit our respective parents in our hometown. SO had just gotten his Masters and we were there to celebrate. SO grandmother has a heart attack the day after we arrive and is in the hospital the whole time we're there. She died 3 separate times and was revived. All planned celebrations are (rightfully) ceased. Return home a week and some later after grandma is stable to find that our power bill is in arrears thanks to a shitty roommate we had and they are threatening to shut off our power.

All planned celebrations are (rightfully) ceased. Return home a week and some later after grandma is stable to find that our power bill is in arrears thanks to a shitty roommate we had and they are threatening to shut off our power.

I work in video production under freelance contracts, and my client said he cannot pay me on time like he was supposed to.  Unfortunately, that means no dinner for me tonight.

If I do find a kind person around these parts, I will definitely be giving back the second I get paid, not to try to make that any leverage, but this seems like an amazing idea that I would love to support for the future.\n\nI live in Lakewood, CO, so there are a fair amount of choices that are taunting me... ;)\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this...\n~Slade",

        "request_text": "I have bad luck. Not just any bad luck, but the kind of bad luck that comes from a) either trying to be a good person and help people out or b) the kind of stupidity that can only result from people taking advantage of you. \n\nAbout three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and \"needed\" to move out of her mother's house. \n\nUnfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for \"extras\" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a \"payment plan\" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity. \n\nApartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud. \n\nShe still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings. \n\nEvery word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to \"pay\" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it. \n\nMy parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.\n\nMy history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.\n\nI have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job. \n\nIn August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me. \n\nThe financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own. \n\nJust recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. \n\nIt is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. \n\nWith vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything. \n\nBy the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3 \n\nEDIT: I am going to school for graphic design, I don't know much about reddit yet but if you want a graphic made for you to display, I'd be happy to do it in a repayment of faith and support for RAOP members. :) ",

I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month. \n\nIt is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards. \n\nWith vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything. \n\nBy the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3 \n\nEDIT: I am going to school for graphic design, I don't know much about reddit yet but if you want a graphic made for you to display, I'd be happy to do it in a repayment of faith and support for RAOP members. :) ",

She's at a new job now, but for the last month we have been struggling with finances to keep all three of us a float and especially keeping our pets fed before us!\nUs three would just be super grateful to have something besides dry pancakes this week, until the first of us sees a paycheck.",

Honestly I'm not even sure where to get pizza around here :3\n\nThanks regardless to you lovely people for this sub even existing!",

Of course I can't show our faces, since the IAMA is rather incriminating... :)  I'm not proud, but I'm not ashamed! \n\nedit:  It'll be [hot dogs and blueberry bagels](http://i.imgur.com/k2SlM.jpg) if nobody wants to help this worthless secadmin in another 30 min or so.  After that, I'll just delete this post. Last thing I need is to have more eyes gandering at that AMA when I start job hunting! :)\n2nd edit:  well I'll call it for tonight.  I sincerely appreciate anyone that read this and considered Randoming a pizza to me, even if you decided against it.  Just the thought is worth it in my book.  We ate some dogs and bagels so we're g2g for tonight.  Thanks so much to everyone.\n\n\n**EDIT:  I withdraw my request for a pizza.  There's others that deserve it more.  The fact that I was paid for a job that I was horrible at does make me feel like I shouldn't be asking for a pizza.  My family and I will be fine.  i appreciate all the offers.  **\n\n**I ask that if you really were going to get me a pizza today, you instead get one for \"halohoppe\".  He obviously has such low opinions of majority of humanity that I think everyone would be better off if his faith was restored slightly.\nI'll admit I was upset when he posted twice about what a scumbag I am, and how I just like free shit, but he's right.  I do like free shit, and I was paid to be in a job that i was not fit for.  i had other duties and continued to work, and had a great boss who was more of a friend.  I have no reason to feel sorry for myself..  Please, get a pizza for halohoppe.  Maybe it will motivate him to pass it forward and actually earn that pizza slice next to his username before bashing others**",

This week is their week, but they are out of town seeing family.  The kitchen is very empty.  Obviously, they'll make it up to me upon their return, but until that time I am on my own.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't get paid from my regular job until Friday (and those of you who might recognize my username know I generate no income from my YouTube/Twitch channels), and the truth is I just can't afford to go grocery shopping until then.  I am almost positive I can make what I have left stretch to Friday, but if anyone is feeling generous I would be most appreciative for any assistance.\n\n\nLooking back, I guess that kind of is a story.  Sorry about that.\n\n\n-Pounce",

This week is their week, but they are out of town seeing family.  The kitchen is very empty.  Obviously, they'll make it up to me upon their return, but until that time I am on my own.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don't get paid from my regular job until Friday (and those of you who might recognize my username know I generate no income from my YouTube/Twitch channels), and the truth is I just can't afford to go grocery shopping until then.  I am almost positive I can make what I have left stretch to Friday, but if anyone is feeling generous I would be most appreciative for any assistance.\n\n\nLooking back, I guess that kind of is a story.  Sorry about that.\n\n\n-Pounce",

I'm not starving, I have some decent food in the fridge, but I would really love some pizza. Pizza is my #1 favorite food, and I usually order some as comfort food. I'm just completely out of money till next friday.\n\nFirst, I get an email this morning from my step mom that our little dog has kidney disease which is why shes been sick a lot lately. Vet gave her a shot of something to see if she could keep food down, but it didn't work, so shes going to be put down. Then I get home today and boot up my new laptop, its wonderful I saved for 6 months to pay for it, I can play every game that's out on ultra settings and have great FPS. After about 20 mins of playing some Skyrim it just shuts off, won't turn on. Hours of tech support online/calling ASUS, I find i have to send it in for repairs/replacement and won't get it back for up to 2-3 weeks. On my old computer now reading reddit and feeling bad. Shitty day. So if anyone would like to send me a pick me up, I would love you forever.",

I'm not starving, I have some decent food in the fridge, but I would really love some pizza. Pizza is my #1 favorite food, and I usually order some as comfort food. I'm just completely out of money till next friday.\n\nFirst, I get an email this morning from my step mom that our little dog has kidney disease which is why shes been sick a lot lately. Vet gave her a shot of something to see if she could keep food down, but it didn't work, so shes going to be put down. Then I get home today and boot up my new laptop, its wonderful I saved for 6 months to pay for it, I can play every game that's out on ultra settings and have great FPS. After about 20 mins of playing some Skyrim it just shuts off, won't turn on. Hours of tech support online/calling ASUS, I find i have to send it in for repairs/replacement and won't get it back for up to 2-3 weeks. On my old computer now reading reddit and feeling bad. Shitty day. So if anyone would like to send me a pick me up, I would love you forever.",

I am looking for a job everyday but no luck yet. I would love to have one night where I do not have to worry about what to feed my son and myself. If someone can help me with pizza I would appreciate it very much. We only have a pizza hut here and I do not have a car so I can not go pick it up it will have to be delivered so I know you have to have a 12.00 order to get delivery. Thank you to anyone who can help me.",

        "request_text": "Honestly, it's almost comical at this point looking at this past week. The amazingness started off with school. I had been working on this massive art project, however I was far behind because no matter what I would do, my teacher would come back saying that personally didn't like it. Not that it wasn't good, she just didn't like it. This put me back roughly 3 days behind everyone else in the class. Come Monday projects are getting turned in, and I don't have mine done because of how far behind I was because of her. She said too bad and told me to better manage my time. Even the other students in the class told her she wasn't being fair and it wasn't my fault. I just say okay, and work to get it in as soon as I can. Tuesday comes. I go into work after class, and go to look at my schedule for the next week. I'm scheduled for 12 hours. I go to ask one of my managers what's up because I literally can't even pay for my gas to drive to work on those hours. Apparently someone decided to start a rumor about me at work that I was tired of working there and that I was bad-mouthing the managers. Instead of coming to talk to me, they listened to the rumors and cut my hours. Wednesday comes around. I'm on my to school when my car starts acting funny. I'm on my way to class, and am almost at the school, so I just try and get the school where I can look at my car. I'm in the parking lot getting ready to pull into a spot when my car dies. Steam starts coming out from under the hood, I knew it had overheated. My temp gauge didn't show it was overheating so it told me that my thermometer was broken. I call my dad and tell him I'm stuck at the school, he says when he gets a chance he'll bring a thermometer up to me and we'd replace it at the school. I wait 20 minutes, start the car up again,  pull into the closest spot, and go to class. I come out from class and look under the hood. Radiator is empty and the resevoir tank is massively overfilled, leading to the thermometer again. I put water in my radiator, and try to start my car; nothing. I try again, hear a loud bang, get a big puff of smoke, and my car dies. I just cracked the engine block, meaning my car is dead. As a side note, my school and work is 40 minutes away one from where I live. I cannot live without having a car. So now I'm having to borrow my dad's car. Next comes Thursday. My parents are going through a very bad divorce, and my dad was having to travel to a different state for the trial. I get a call from him late in the afternoon, in which he's very upset with me. The day before I told my mom about my car, and told her I was using my dad's car, and then she asked how my dad was going to the trial. This was where I made my mistake: I told her that he was using his company credit card. Apparently she used this information in court against him, and it wasn't something even his lawyer knew about. Now my dad is upset with me because he thinks he can't say anything to me because I'll just go to my mom. I'm not talking to my mom right now because she took something I told her because I thought she would be concerned about me and instead just used it to her own advantage. Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.\n\nTL;DR: Cunt teacher, rumors at work leading to cut hours, cracked engine block, can't talk to either of my parents right now.

We have a large check coming in the mail, but we didn't get it today because of the holiday. We are currently staying in a Motel 6 for a week, to scout/establish places to live, as we FINALLY after a year and a half of hard work, destitution, doubt and confidence, and above all courage, enough money to get (and keep) ourselves afloat, and enough clientele to support us through the months. \nWe're getting an apartment with the money that's coming in (and of course food), but we had planned on renting a single bed motel room for a week for $259, which would've left us with more than enough for simple groceries. They only had a 2 bed avaliable, for about $290. We only had about $310 in cash at that point, so needless to say that the remainder of the money is gone, and we were reliant on that check coming in today to be able to eat. Christopher Columbus! Note, we have NO where else to stay besides outside, no family, nothing.\n\nWe haven't ate a meal in around 30 hours, and while we've gone much, much longer before (box of cheerios and a bag of Ore Ida fries for a week... lol) , we just really don't want to go through the slow agony of starving again, especially when we're so on the cusp of being self reliant.\n\nSo I ask if there's any kind soul out there that would bless us with a pizza tonight, with the full intention of us paying you back within the next few days if wanted.

We have only had Juice and Water for the last 24 days, We started June 1st and will be ending June 30th. We will then be having Vegetables and fruit for the next 15 days to break the fast properly, working our way to solid foods. We have enough money for Pizza, but I was wondering if anyone wanted to treat us and be the person to give us our first Pizza / order out since the fast. That would be sometime around mid July. Sorry if I am doing this wrong. I just been lurking in this subreddit for some time, and thinking pizza this whole month.
