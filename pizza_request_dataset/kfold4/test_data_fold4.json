My next decent paycheck isn't until January 10th (I do have a very small one coming in on Friday, but because one of my two jobs isn't active during the winter break, said check will be very small and immediately eaten by groceries). I'm not out of food yet and can probably make it until then. I'm just kind of lonely and really want a pizza.\n\nI'm prepared to do that verification thingy mentioned in the sidebar. I am also prepared to make you a really bad drawing in MS Paint, because I'm bored and don't have that much to do.\n\nAlso, Merry slightly-early Christmas!",

I work a full-time job and currently drained my savings for a car so I didn't have to ride the metro back and forth to work. \nI've been on Reddit for over a year and helped a lot of people out in r/assistance, if someone could help me out it would mean a lot, I'm currently extremely dizzy and I think it's due to the lack of food.\nPlease PM for proof and my real account name, I'd be glad to pay it back or pay it forward. \n\nEdit: If someone would still like to help I'd appreciate it, I can't pick up my check until 5PM tomorrow so it would be awesome to wake up to something. \n\nThanks.",

There's a really messed up situation and I haven't even told my dad about this yet, so I don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.\n\nI got a surprise yesterday when a guy I've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! She was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!\n\nAfter a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!\n\nI'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid. But for today, I need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and I think he would appreciate it too.\n\nSorry again for being a bit deceptive with my post. If I wasn't starving I wouldn't be spreading it around for that matter either. If anyone can help you have my gratitude. \n\n8:30 AM. Taking a trip out and about, will be back in a few hours to check the thread.\n\nEdit: 5.15 PM-- The generous contribution of another redditor who chooses to remain anonymous (like a boss) has secured dinner for me on this fine evening. I thank the dozens of folks who offered encouragement in thread and through PM as well as the others who flamed and trolled me so diligently. Ripping into you was an awesome way to blow off some steam, so you helped out a lot too. Thanks again to everyone, here's to a brighter future.",

My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.\n\n\nMy two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.\n\n\nI would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!\n\n\nThe pic for our huge TECO deposit :/\nhttp://imgur.com/B0uoo",

However we moved recently in our new apartment and were already late on rent so all our money went towards bills. My father is lending us gas money tomorrow to get to the food pantry but today I'm not sure what we are going to do. \n\nMy husbands father is staying a couple weeks with us because he wasn't getting the proper care where he lives at. He has heart problems and is diabetic, and he has to eat which makes me feel terrible because we had to pay a more big of a late fee then I thought and I feel that we are letting him down by us as well not giving him the proper care he needs.   \n\nWe have no children so I can understand if we aren't helped.\n\nHowever, if someone does help, I can give them my real account name, and I wouldn't mind taking a picture as well, whatever works.\n\nThanks.

However we moved recently in our new apartment and were already late on rent so all our money went towards bills. My father is lending us gas money tomorrow to get to the food pantry but today I'm not sure what we are going to do. \n\nMy husbands father is staying a couple weeks with us because he wasn't getting the proper care where he lives at. He has heart problems and is diabetic, and he has to eat which makes me feel terrible because we had to pay a more big of a late fee then I thought and I feel that we are letting him down by us as well not giving him the proper care he needs.   \n\nWe have no children so I can understand if we aren't helped.\n\nHowever, if someone does help, I can give them my real account name, and I wouldn't mind taking a picture as well, whatever works.\n\nThanks.

Since I'm disabled, and still waiting for my benefits to start, I knew I could never afford a place for myself.. So I did what most people in my situation would do.. I had faith that between my family and all my friends..  SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought.. Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. Since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, I had to move on to my good friends.. My best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn't an option.. My other best friend AND neighbor would definitely take me in.. I just knew she would!!  She has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. So I asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. Without even pretending to think about it.. She said \"I don't have any room for you\".. That was it.. I had exhausted all my options.. One day before my eviction I started to plan the best way to be homeless.. I decided to live in my van.... Scary doesn't come close to how I felt, but my fear was deep.... Ring Ring! It's Curtis.. A friend I met thru my best friend.. I knew him and considered him a friend but we didn't know each other very well.. Without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  I burst into tears.. I was relieved.. But mostly, I was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as I am!  So here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. Trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat TONIGHT.. Let alone tomorrow.. But It's 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. I want Curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!  Thanks for reading! :)",

Tomorrow I will go on the 30 day processing list for SNAP, they accepted a medicaid application for me and my daughter, and put me on the 2 year waiting list for daycare assistance. I picked her up from daycare and brought her home to give her a bath and as we were filling up the tub I noticed it looked dirty. Then it looked really dirty and red. I stopped the water and got her out of the tub and checked all of our faucets. All had icky brownish red water coming out of them. Needless to say, I'm not cooking tonight and am waiting for the utility company to call me back.

I also plan to frequent this subreddit after every payday from now on because I honestly never thought I'd be here. Thanks, Reddit. :)\n\nEdit: I'm in Southern Oregon. Is there something else I should include?",

My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are \"resealing\" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.  If someone would send a pizza to our new place it would make me (and I'm sure my brother...he loves pizza) the happiest mover that has ever walked the planet!",

Somewhere along that path girl starts working for scumbag corporation. When it comes time for maternity leave as the lil' redditor is close to being born, scumbag corporation says 'don't worry, all of your benefits will continue, you'll get paid leave, have fun with teh baby cuddles.' \n\nWell, we really wish it had worked out like that :( I took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to FMLA. 7 Weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over. \n\nLuckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. We'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven. As soon as we get caught up financially, which according to my strict budget won't be until late November, I plan on doing the same for another redditor in need! \n\ntl,dr; My company is basically making me pay for my maternity leave after the fact, to the sum of $2400. We can't afford groceries because of this right now and would just love one night where we can have the luxury of a pizza. Thanks!",

Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading. \n\nHe took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.\n\nToday I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives. \n\nAlso being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along. \n\nTL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To \"protect\" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.\n\nedit: never done this so forgive me. forgot to add that im in the san diego area\n\nedit2: RZF291 is a scholar and a gentlemen!

Our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them.\n4. One roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. Probably to keep from crying. We think pizza would help.\n5. This same roommate just announced that she had to fart. We need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste.\n6. Lucy is lost.\n7. We can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either).\n8.

One roommate is banging her head on her desk and if we had a pizza it would be a good cushion so she wouldn't hurt her head.\n3. Our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them.\n4. One roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. Probably to keep from crying. We think pizza would help.\n5. This same roommate just announced that she had to fart. We need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste.\n6. Lucy is lost.\n7. We can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either).\n8. I just needed to have one more reason so that our list would have an even number of reasons because odd numbers are gross.\n\nPeace and blessins'\n",

Hopefully it wasn't stolen or anything and it's still where I left it in the car.\n\nAnyway I don't want to ramble, but to sum it up, my Sister and I would be very grateful to anyone willing to help someone out in a tough spot with some pizza.

Fortunately it was just her and I in the car and they hit the back passenger door, because had they of hit just a foot or two up, I don't think we both would have survived.\nWe were both taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and my wallet was left in our total'd car which was towed. Hopefully it wasn't stolen or anything and it's still where I left it in the car.\n\nAnyway I don't want to ramble, but to sum it up, my Sister and I would be very grateful to anyone willing to help someone out in a tough spot with some pizza. When things get settled out here and I get back on my feet(literally!) then definitely plan on returning the favor to someone who's in a bind and could use the help.\n\nThank you so much!",

To be honest, I was looking forward to free meals with his family, but I decided it wasn't worth it.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that I'm one of those people who doesn't eat when they're stressed out, so right now it's just me, a box of wine, and whatever I ate yesterday hanging out in the house.  Logic tells me I should eat.   Anyone?\n\nI would absolutely love to pay it forward when I have my feet on the ground.\n",

        "request_text": "So, about a 2 months ago, I found a job. It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.\n\nI also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.\n\nAnd then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.\n\n(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) \n\nMy boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.\n\nSo, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.\n\nSorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(\n\nTL;DR: Broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway. Would love pizza. Would also love to give pizza when I can afford it.",

It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.\n\nI also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.\n\nAnd then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.\n\n(I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.) \n\nMy boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.\n\nSo, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.\n\nSorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(\n\nTL;DR: Broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway. Would love pizza. Would also love to give pizza when I can afford it.",

Last sememster I Decided to change majors and it cost me so much in scholarships that I cannot afford school Anylonger. I figured I would work for a semester, maybe a year, then go back to school and keep moving forward. Well I work at a video game store and I love it. The one problem is that I am having to PAyfor things that I usually didn't have to before. So while struggling I decided to consider the military. I did a lot of research and am now deciding between the Marines and the Army. I want to join the Marines but I am keeping my options open until I get as much info as I can. I am going to be moving back in with my parents next month in order to try to save some money but until then I have been living off of granola bars and the occasional ramen. I've had to sell my video games and musical instruments to pay rent and such and have to pay for gas in change most if the time. Anyways thank you for your time. \n\nTL;DR: struggling hungry dude moving in with parents in order to survive till joining the military.\n\nP.S. this whole thing was typed on an iPhone so sorry for any errors.",

Last sememster I Decided to change majors and it cost me so much in scholarships that I cannot afford school Anylonger. I figured I would work for a semester, maybe a year, then go back to school and keep moving forward. Well I work at a video game store and I love it. The one problem is that I am having to PAyfor things that I usually didn't have to before. So while struggling I decided to consider the military. I did a lot of research and am now deciding between the Marines and the Army. I want to join the Marines but I am keeping my options open until I get as much info as I can. I am going to be moving back in with my parents next month in order to try to save some money but until then I have been living off of granola bars and the occasional ramen. I've had to sell my video games and musical instruments to pay rent and such and have to pay for gas in change most if the time. Anyways thank you for your time. \n\nTL;DR: struggling hungry dude moving in with parents in order to survive till joining the military.\n\nP.S. this whole thing was typed on an iPhone so sorry for any errors.",

Pay is ok but the shitty thing is that I get a check once a month. Pay day is not til August 8 and the money I have saved is for rent/groceries. Can't afford eating out and  all the stores (that have food) will be closed by the time I get home. ( I live in the \"cuts\" (working class, , lower economic ladder neighborhood; suburban \"firstworldproblem\" type people might call it a \"ghetto\" or a \"hood\" but to me it's great place with cheap rent with great neighbors but a poor ratio of liquor stores to supermarkets or corner stores will actual food) \n\nEDIT : Thanks to everyone who upvoted this. I have received information regarding an ecard to use to get pizza. THANK YOU REDDIT FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN!",

I love reading other people's pizza'd experience. \n\nI started a new job as a baker for Stop n Shop after not having a steady one for the past three years. I absolutely love working due to my natural high energy level, so it's awesome! However my body is adjusting to the activity level which is one of the highest in my life - I also dance daily since I found rhythmic movement is necessary for me to regulate my emotions and impulses. However since I'm broke due to screwing up my landlady's dirt patch and rent being due, I'm on the beans/ramen/seitan diet which I don't actually mind at all except I dropped six pounds in the past week and every muscle in my body hurts in a new way. I can't afford used clothes from the thrift store anytime this month unless I get birthday money, can't afford to take the bus home, and I don't get paid til Thursday. \n\nThe pizza wouldn't just be for me. Fortunately I live with two wonderful supportive lovers (closed poly triad). My bf helped me out giving me a lift home a couple times because cars beep at me and people yell stuff while walk home from work exhausted :( Our gf is in chronic pain and feeling depressed due to trying to be a bio major after going through two windshields and injuring her ankle BAD on the job when I met her. I would love to cheer her up with cheesy goodness, since they are also broke.\n\nThanks RAOP!",

So just leave some details on a map you'd like me to make, I usually map in boom format so pretty much any source port should run it. If you have a midi in mind for me to use post it! (No mp3s please. I think boom might run ogg but I'm not sure). Also I'm a bit of a slaughter mapper, so I might go a biiiiit heavy on the mob count. I don't intend on spending more than a week on the map, so nothing too big.\n\n\nAnd just to plug my projects a bit:\n\n[newgothic](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=16238)\n\n[shai'tan's luck](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=15945)\n\nI've also done a map for Plutonia Revisited and 2 in the 1994 redux project.\n\n[expect something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BNYCR3rSMY)\n\n\n[not like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgmG9dMJNbQ)",

I have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when I don't talk to at least one of my siblings via Steam or Facebook. I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.\n\nTheir financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. I've been where they are, and I know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food. \n\nHere's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jDz5L.jpg\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who's taken the time to read this.",

Now the children shall starve... unless we can feed them another way?\n\nFor a nominal fee of providing edible sustenance that doesn't slurp when I eat it, I shall impart stories of epic proportions based on the whims of the provider. In other words I'll draft a short story based on whatever meaningful or outright ridiculous crap you come up with. Am I any good at writing? Well, I won a Presidential writing award in third grade for an essay I did. I also helped ghost write 2 published works, one of which is in it's fourth printing. The other one was just a paycheck, that lady never stood a chance from the beginning.\n\nThe genre is up to you, I can write anything fiction without much trouble. If you want Optimus Prime to viciously beat Rainbow Brite with a broken Buzz Lightyear doll, I'll assemble the necessary back story =). All created works are royalty free, so turn em in to short story contests, publish them in a magazine, whatever.\n\nI am hoping for at least $25 dollars worth of food, I can toss together a good read for that much, and I can eat a couple days off that. But longevity wise I need food for the rest of the week, so the more you donate the longer it'll be.

Now the children shall starve... unless we can feed them another way?\n\nFor a nominal fee of providing edible sustenance that doesn't slurp when I eat it, I shall impart stories of epic proportions based on the whims of the provider. In other words I'll draft a short story based on whatever meaningful or outright ridiculous crap you come up with. Am I any good at writing? Well, I won a Presidential writing award in third grade for an essay I did. I also helped ghost write 2 published works, one of which is in it's fourth printing. The other one was just a paycheck, that lady never stood a chance from the beginning.\n\nThe genre is up to you, I can write anything fiction without much trouble. If you want Optimus Prime to viciously beat Rainbow Brite with a broken Buzz Lightyear doll, I'll assemble the necessary back story =). All created works are royalty free, so turn em in to short story contests, publish them in a magazine, whatever.\n\nI am hoping for at least $25 dollars worth of food, I can toss together a good read for that much, and I can eat a couple days off that. But longevity wise I need food for the rest of the week, so the more you donate the longer it'll be.

        "request_text": "Hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \"dick\"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([Ana](http://i.imgur.com/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.\n\n.\n\nPS: When we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward. Today you, tomorrow me.\n",

This is the first job I've found this summer, though!

Or just wish me good luck on my new job, for hopefully soon I can afford my own pizza! And IDEALLY, pizza for others, too!",

If I have any other family I don't know them so spending the holidays with anyone is out of the question. My girlfriend went up to Tennessee but I couldn't get off work so eating with her family is out of the question. And my best friend of over three years told me flat out today his wife doesn't want me to come because her parents are going to be there. So for the first time in my life I'm completely alone on turkey day and it's depressing the heck out of me.\n\nSo yeah, no family or friends or money means no black olives, turkey, gravy, those little marshmallows, etc for me tomorrow. Any way I could score some pizza money today so I can get some wings or something? I'd much rather warm something up tomorrow than eat a can of plain tuna or some lousy canned spaghetti.

So, today i finally met my first in person redditor and i have to say, it was amazing. (ive been a lurker since the whole Digg v4 fiasco, but i decided to make an account a few days ago so i can be somebody in this community for once. Anyway, she told me about this subreddit where if youre hungry, short on cash, or are willing to meet some sort of requirement, someone will order you a pizza. So heres my shot. Basically im pretty broke at the moment. I live with a roommate but i really dont want to go through her fridge and be \"that guy\" who eats what he wants even if it isnt his. I make minimum wage (30hrs a wekk) in my state but luckily i work about 3 miles away so i dont spend much on fuel. I have 3 children and i was divorced almost a year ago. About half my monthly income goes to child support and random bills (i was an idiot and got a title loan at a desperate time in my life and i still have to pay a pretty hefty monthly payment for a few more months. My state says i make too much to receive food stamps so i have to pay for all my food with cash and also food for when i get my children on the weekends (i want to make sure they have 3 good healthy meals a day when theyre here). so heres where i ask, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, will you please buy me some pizza, im sure it will be left overs and help me out through out the week until im payed on friday. im willing to do whatever tasks im needed to earn this pizza. I love Reddit and all it stands for, especially subreddits like these (assistance, suicidewatch) I live in Idaho if that helps any fellow Idahoan Redditors. Thanks Reddit.",

So, today i finally met my first in person redditor and i have to say, it was amazing. (ive been a lurker since the whole Digg v4 fiasco, but i decided to make an account a few days ago so i can be somebody in this community for once. Anyway, she told me about this subreddit where if youre hungry, short on cash, or are willing to meet some sort of requirement, someone will order you a pizza. So heres my shot. Basically im pretty broke at the moment. I live with a roommate but i really dont want to go through her fridge and be \"that guy\" who eats what he wants even if it isnt his. I make minimum wage (30hrs a wekk) in my state but luckily i work about 3 miles away so i dont spend much on fuel. I have 3 children and i was divorced almost a year ago. About half my monthly income goes to child support and random bills (i was an idiot and got a title loan at a desperate time in my life and i still have to pay a pretty hefty monthly payment for a few more months.
