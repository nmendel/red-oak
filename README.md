Running genetic algorithm:
python GeneticAlgorithm.py dummy_scores.csv 30 100

Note: make sure you can run python from the command line, I set the below environment variables to make that work (in windows):
PATH=C:\python27_x64
PYTHONPATH=C:\python27_x64\Lib;C:\python27_x64\Lib\lib-tk;C:\python27_x64\DLLs
